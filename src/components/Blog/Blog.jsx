        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. What is One way data binding?</h2>
        <p>
          One-way data binding is a data flow pattern where information travels in only one direction: from the data source (usually a component's state or a variable) to the UI elements (like HTML elements). In this pattern, changes in the data source are reflected in the UI, but changes in the UI do not affect the data source directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in React, you can achieve one-way data binding by passing data down from parent components to child components through props. When the parent component's state changes, the changes are propagated down the component tree via props, and child components re-render to reflect the updated data.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. What is NPM in Node.js?</h2>
        <p>
          NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage packages and dependencies for Node.js projects. NPM provides a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and tools that can be easily integrated into Node.js applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers can use NPM to install packages globally or locally, manage project dependencies, and execute scripts defined in the package.json file. With NPM, developers can streamline the development process by leveraging existing packages and focusing on building specific functionalities for their applications.

      {/* Question 3: MongoDB vs MySQL */}
      <div>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Difference between MongoDB database vs MySQL database</h2>
        <p>
          MongoDB and MySQL are both popular database management systems, but they differ in their data models, schemas, and use cases.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2">
          <li><strong>Data Model:</strong> MongoDB is a NoSQL database, meaning it stores data in a JSON-like format known as BSON (Binary JSON). It supports flexible schemas, allowing each document in a collection to have a different structure. MySQL, on the other hand, is a relational database that uses structured tables with predefined schemas.</li>
          <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data across multiple nodes or clusters. MySQL can scale vertically by adding more resources to a single server but may face limitations in handling massive amounts of data.</li>
          <li><strong>Query Language:</strong> MongoDB uses a query language based on JSON-like documents. It supports rich queries, including embedded documents and arrays. MySQL uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying, which is powerful for complex joins and transactions.</li>
          <li><strong>ACID Transactions:</strong> MySQL is ACID-compliant, ensuring Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability for transactions. MongoDB supports multi-document transactions, providing similar ACID guarantees for operations on multiple documents.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Choosing between MongoDB and MySQL depends on the specific requirements of your application. If you need flexibility in your data schema, handle large volumes of unstructured data, and prefer a JSON-based document store, MongoDB might be a suitable choice. On the other hand, if your application requires a predefined schema, strong consistency, and transactional support, MySQL could be the better option.
